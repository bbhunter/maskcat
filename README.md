`Maskcat` is a multi-tool for working with text streams for password cracking.

Maskcat (`cat` mask) focuses on the usage of masks to extract and transform text and features several functions:

   - Making `hashcat` masks from `stdin`
   - Matching words from `stdin` to masks
   - Substituting tokens into `stdin` using masks
   - Mutating `stdin` with masks for new candidates
   - Generating tokens from `stdin` by extracting input
   - Creating partial masks from `stdin` by selecting character sets
   - Removing characters from `stdin` by selecting character sets
   - Creating retain masks from `stdin` by selecting tokens to retain
   - Mutating `stdin` with retain masks for new candidates that retain tokens
   - Filtering `stdin` for masks that are below an entropy threshold

Maskcat also supports several options to assist in being a flexible and powerful tool:

- Multibyte text support
- Auto-dehexing text support
- Configurable number of replacements
- Additional fuzz configuration for replacements to create unique output

Maskcat fits into a small tool ecosystem for password cracking and is designed for lightweight and easy usage with its companion tools:

### Install from Go
```
go install github.com/jakewnuk/maskcat@latest
```
```
go install github.com/jakewnuk/maskcat@v1.2.0
```

### Install from Source
```

```

### Current Version 1.2.0:

```
Options for maskcat (version 1.2.0):

  -d    Process $HEX[...] text (warning: slows processes)
        Example: maskcat [MODE] -d
  -f int
        Adds extra fuzz to the replacement functions
        Example: maskcat [MODE] -f 1
  -m    Process multibyte text (warning: slows processes)
        Example: maskcat [MODE] -m
  -n int
        Max number of replacements to make per item (default: 1)
        Example: maskcat [MODE] -n 1 (default 1)
  -v    Show verbose information about masks
        Example: maskcat [MODE] -v

Modes for maskcat (version 1.2.0):

  mask          Creates masks from text
                Example: stdin | maskcat mask [OPTIONS]

  match         Matches text to masks
                Example: stdin | maskcat match [MASK-FILE] [OPTIONS]

  sub           Replaces text with text from a file with masks
                Example: stdin | maskcat sub [TOKENS-FILE] [OPTIONS]

  mutate        Mutates text by using chunking and token swapping
                Example: stdin | maskcat mutate [MIN-TOKEN-SIZE] [OPTIONS]

  tokens        Splits text into tokens and only print certain lengths (values over 99 allow all)
                Example: stdin | maskcat tokens [TOKEN-LEN] [OPTIONS]

  partial       Partially replaces characters with mask characters
                Example: stdin | maskcat partial [MASK-CHARS] [OPTIONS]

  remove        Removes characters that match given mask characters
                Example: stdin | maskcat remove [MASK-CHARS] [OPTIONS]

  retain        Creates retain masks by keeping text from a file
                Example: stdin | maskcat retain [TOKENS-FILE] [OPTIONS]

  splice        Mutates text by using retain masks and token swapping
                Example: stdin | maskcat splice [TOKENS-FILE] [OPTIONS]

  filter        Only prints masks below a maximum entropy threshold
                Example: stdin | maskcat filter [ENTROPY-MAX] [OPTIONS]
```
